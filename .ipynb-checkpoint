    " * Locations that contribute more data will have a greater effect on what the top results will be.\n",
    " * Population (in terms of a country's people) may also have an effect on defining trends. The more people that have access to Google, the more likely it is that terms from that location will be surging in popularity.\n",

    "***\n",
    "We found that each platform has their unique features and limitations. \n",
    "-  Google Trends shows vast historical data for search keywords for overall topics. It's limitation is that it doesn't show the amount of searches.\n",
    "-  Youtube is a reputable platform for mostly Music and Entertainment categories. Youtube public dataset is very detailed allow users to go deep in historical data.\n",
    "-  The Twitter platform produced different results than Google. Each site appeals to sports fans differently. When searching for a league on Google, the top three results are scores with highlights, news and recent twitter posts. Twitter is a great way to become involed in the trending topics surrounding sports and to connect with teams and players. It's limitation is that it only provides 7 days worth of data. "
